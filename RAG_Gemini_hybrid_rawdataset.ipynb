His father would travel all over West Africa for six months at a time - from Senegal to Sierra Leone - fixing timepieces.At one stage Baba Bala was based in the capital, Abuja, where many of the country's elite live - and he made a good living tending to the watches of the wealthy.He reckons his best customers were top officials of the state-owned oil firm Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC).Some had Rolexes - these can vary wildly in price but an average one costs around $10,000 (\\u00a38,000).He says they are beautiful - and encapsulate his love for all watches from Switzerland. He himself owns a Longines, another prestigious Swiss brand, which he only removes when he sleeps.\\\"If I step out of my house and I forgot it, I have to go back for it. I will not be without it - that is how important it is to me.\\\"At his shop, he keeps a beautiful big framed photo of his father, Abdullahi Bala Isah, taken as he looked up from his work bench a few years before his death in 1988. Isah was a renowned horologist and his contacts in Freetown and Dakar would call him to take a trip when they had enough watches for him to tend to.He would also make regular visits to Ibadan, a metropolis in the south-west of Nigeria - a literary hub and home to the country's first university.Baba Bala says no-one in the family knows where his father learnt his expertise - but it would have been at the time of British colonial rule.He himself was born four years before Nigeria's independence in 1960.\\\"My father was a popular wristwatch repairer and his skill took him to many places.

Apple's share price fell during its  \\\"Glowtime\\\" event, where it unveiled the iPhone 16 as well as other products, and ended the day flat. The company, worth $3 trillion, is facing concern that it is losing its edge in the burgeoning area of artificial intelligence.Sales of the iPhone - Apple's most important product which accounts for around half of its total sales - have stalled in recent months. They slipped by 1% over the nine months ended 29 June compared with a year earlier.Apple said its new phones, which come with longer lasting batteries, more powerful chips and enhanced privacy features, were its first built specifically to handle AI and its new \\\"Apple Intelligence\\\" tools, many of which were announced in June. Those include new tools for writing and creating new emojis as well incorporating OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT into Siri to help users with some queries and text generation requests.On Monday, Apple also announced updates to its Apple Watch and its AirPod headphones, which will allow them to automatically drop the volume when users start in-person conversations and to decline calls with the shake of a head.It said the Pro version of its AirPods would be able to be used as a \\\"clinical grade\\\" personal hearing aid for people with mild or moderate hearing loss.The company said it was expecting marketing approval from regulators for the device \\\"soon\\\" and the feature would be available this autumn in more than 100 countries, including the US, Germany and Japan.Previously, the company had a feature that allowed people to pair hearing aids with iPhones and other devices.The products were rolled out at a glossy event where protestors gathered in a designated free speech area across the street, urging executives to ramp up efforts to protect children from dangerous content in the company\\u2019s App Store.The protest featured a life-sized blow-up made to resemble Mr Cook. Sales of the new range start in September, with prices for the iPhone16 starting at $799. But the Apple Intelligence features are not set to be available on operating systems until October, starting in the US and heading to other countries in the following months. They will be available in the UK in December.Ben Wood, chief analyst at the market research firm CCS Insight, said it was likely that many people would dismiss the company's new camera control as a \\\"glorified shutter button\\\". But he said it offered \\\"very significant\\\" upgrades, including visual, AI-powered search and he came away from the presentation persuaded that Apple would win over customers.\\\"The combination of Apple Intelligence and new camera features on the iPhone 16 will help spur upgrades from loyal Apple customers,\\\" he said. \\\"Particularly as Apple is positioning this latest update as being a future-proof purchase for customers wanting to get Apple Intelligence features as they roll out over the next few years.\\\" Apple has been slower than rivals Samsung and Google to bake generative AI features for photo editing, translation and web browsing into its devices.Competitors are now building them into folding, flipping and even tri-folding smartphones.Pre-orders for Huawei's new tri-fold phone, the Mate XT, reportedly hit more than three million on Monday.Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said because Apple was rolling out AI-ready smartphones later than rivals, it was \\\"critical\\\" they deliver.She warned that rolling the features out before they were ready could risk their reputation or prompt sales losses.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 752,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The YouTubers exploring their family homelands\\n\\nBangladesh, Morocco and the self-declared republic of Somaliland does not read like the typical lad's holiday wishlist. But a group of friends have turned their backs on traditional destinations - and are racking up millions of views on social media by discovering their family's homelands instead.London-born Abu Finiin, Kayum Miah and Zak Hajjaj, who call themselves Kids of the Colony, have travelled to all three countries to learn more about their cultural heritage.During their trips they met a relative claiming to be the world's oldest man, picked up work in tiny sea ports and drank camel's milk straight from the udder. \\\"It's about children of immigrants coming together and telling their stories,\\\" Abu said. \\\"Where you are from, matters.\\\"The friends, who met at school and are all aged 22, have created a docuseries for YouTube and regularly post their adventures on TikTok and Instagram.Their main goals were to connect with their backgrounds, live how their families lived and showcase it to the world.\\u201cInstead of going on holidays to a country where we have no cultural ties to, [we thought] let's go to the countries where we're from, \\\" said Abu.They recruited friends Anas Omar and Henry Harte to film their travels and, self-financing their mission, they set off.\\\"We wanted to tell these stories in a way that was fun, entertaining, and in a way that second-generation immigrants that might be a bit detached from their homeland could relate to,\\\" Abu added. Abu and Zak met at primary school with Kayum joining them at Central Foundation Boys School in Islington. Their first trip was last year, to Bangladesh, where Kayum's parents lived until they emigrated to the UK in the 1970s.\\\"It was very surreal, especially when we went to my actual house and seeing [my friends] in the village - it was hilarious to see,\\\" he said. Their YouTube videos show them travelling through the bustling streets of Dhaka, visiting picturesque Silhet, meeting locals and Kayum's grandfather - who insists he is 120 years old. \\\"That was one of my favourite bits, going to Kayum's village and realising that I'm probably the first non-Bengali person to ever be here,\\\" Abu said.\\\"You know when you're visiting a country, especially a country like Bangladesh, they will sell you a tour or a package holiday where you don't get the real experience. \\\"But being with [Kayum's] family we got the real, raw experience - mosquitos and cockroaches included.\\\" Returning to London, they discovered they had racked up over 100,000 views and 6,000 YouTube subscribers in the first week of Kids of the Colony going live. They also received a lot of love from the Bengali community.\\\"For me it was when people were saying, 'my family watch your videos' or 'my parents watch it' or 'you're my dad's favourite character' - that's when I realised that yeah, we've created something special here,\\\" Abu said. Zak, who has a Moroccan father and English mother, took the group to Marrakesh. After finding it a bit too touristy for their liking they headed to the city of Larache, known for its agriculture and fishing, to meet some of Zak's relatives.\\\"I thought we were slightly losing the essence of [Kids of the Colony] in Marrakesh because we got caught up in the tourism,\\\" said Abu.\\\"But I feel like moments in Larache, when I was with Zak's family, in his family home, that really captured what this is.\\\" In June they went to Somaliland, a breakaway republic in the Horn of Africa, where Abu's family emigrated from in 1991.The friends utilised TikTok to show people they were in the capital Hargeisa, a destination not known for tourism especially amongst non-Somalis.They live-streamed their daily experiences and previewed upcoming videos, garnering millions of views.\\\"I felt like we were all ready to create something special which I think we did.\\\" Abu said. He said having his friends visit Hargeisa and meet his family was surreal.\\\"I felt pride,\\\" he said. \\\"I knew I was doing something amazing and I knew that the country would appreciate it.\\\"I was from London and born there and I'm spreading the word about my country - a country that's not recognised too.\\\"It was great seeing the guys interact with my family and one thing I love is how involved everyone got into the culture and embraced it.\\\" Anas, who filmed Bangladesh, Morocco, and Somaliland, said he found the trips fresh and intriguing.\\\"I'm half-Moroccan half-Palestinian and being able to visit my friends' homelands has been very special,\\\" he said.\\\"It's so entertaining and to watch it - first as a cameraman and being a first viewer - it's an honour and a privilege. \\\"I would love to take them to Palestine one day.\\\" Henry, a filmmaker and photographer who Abu reached out to through social media, said the experience had been incredible. \\\"Being a white guy in Somaliland was a really fun experience because people were so accepting and excited that I was there, because they don't have a lot of tourism,\\\" he said.\\\"I got welcomed with open arms and everyone was so kind and gentle and it was the most beautiful place I think I've ever been.\\\"They experienced drinking camel's milk together which Henry said was \\\"the craziest and probably the stupidest thing we did out there\\\" - they all fell ill for 48 hours after. The friends told the BBC they had a very clear idea about what they wanted their audience to take away from their videos. \\\"Maybe a 15-year-old watching this that might be Somali or from Bangladesh, I hope they really reconnect to their roots,\\\" Abu said.\\\"And yes, you can be proud of it, and your stories matter, your countries matter and you can create positive, wholesome stories in countries that don't have that image.\\\" During their trip to Somaliland they took photographs exploring the difference between London and Hargeisa's cultures and hope to exhibit them. They hope their Kids of the Colony series can connect with many people, regardless of background. \\\"You don't have to be Somali to enjoy the Somaliland series, you don't have to be Bengali to think about your identity and where you're from when watching the Bangladesh series,\\\" said Abu.\\\"There's an abundance of stories there that I hope to uncover and tell, there's so many more people to be represented - so this is very much the first step.\\\"\",\n          \"The clocks that take hours to wind back\\n\\nWhen British Summer Time (BST) ends each year, the collections officer at a Victorian country house in Cornwall prepares herself for a busy day at work.At Lanhydrock, near Bodmin, which is run by the National Trust, the end of BST means Faye Rason has to wind 20 clocks back an hour - a process that can take two-and-a-half hours.Usually it takes her an hour-and-a-half each week to manually wind the clock collection, but turning them back takes longer, she said.One particularly challenging timepiece is a walnut long case clock made in 1740 because it chimes eight bells every 15 minutes - making putting it back a noisy affair.

What happened to this stellar sibling?\\n\\nMany stars in our galaxy exist in pairs, but our Sun is a notable exception. Now scientists are finding clues that it may once have had a companion of its own. The question is, where did it go? Our Sun is a bit of an isolated nomad. Orbiting in one of the Milky Way's spiral arms, it takes us on a journey around the galaxy roughly once every 230 million years on our lonesome. The nearest star to our Sun, Proxima Centauri, is 4.2 light-years away, so remote that it would take even the fastest spacecraft ever built more than 7,000 years to reach. Everywhere we look in our galaxy however, the star at the centre of our Solar System seems like more and more of an anomaly. Binary stars \\u2013 stars that orbit the galaxy inexorably linked together as pairs \\u2013 appear to be common. Recently astronomers have even spotted a pair orbiting in surprisingly close proximity to the supermassive black hole that sits at the heart of the Milky Way \\u2013 a location that astrophysicists thought would cause the stars to be ripped apart from each other or squashed together by the intense gravity. In fact, discoveries of binary star systems are now so common that some scientists believe that perhaps all stars were once in binary relationships \\u2013 born as pairs, each with a stellar sibling. That has led to an intriguing question: was our own Sun once a binary star too, its companion lost long ago? It's definitely a possibility, says Gongjie Li, an astronomer at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US. \\\"And it's very interesting.\\\" Fortunately for us, our Sun does not have a companion today. If it did, the gravitational pull of a solar sibling could have disrupted the orbit of the Earth and the other planets, condemning our home to lurches from extreme heat to terrible cold in a way that may have been too inhospitable for life. The closest binary stars to Earth, Alpha Centauri A and B, orbit each other at about 24 times the Earth-Sun distance, or 3.6 billion miles. Suggestions that our Sun could also have a faint companion circling our Solar System today \\u2013 a hypothetical star often called Nemesis \\u2013 have fallen out of favour since they were first proposed in 1984 after no such star was found in multiple surveys and studies. But when our Sun first formed 4.6 billion years ago, however, it may have been a different matter. Stars form when giant clouds of dust and gas tens of light-years across cool and clump together. The material inside these nebulae \\u2013 as these cocoons of gas and dust are known \\u2013 collapse together under gravity into ever growing lumps. As it does so, it begins to warm up over millions of years, eventually igniting nuclear fusion to create a protostar with a disk of remnant debris spinning around it, which forms planets. In 2017, Sarah Sadavoy, an astrophysicist at Queen's University in Canada, used data from a radio survey of the Perseus molecular cloud \\u2013 a stellar nursery filled with young binary star systems \\u2013 to conclude that the process of star formation might preferentially form protostars in pairs. Indeed, she and her colleagues found it was so likely that they suggested all stars might form in pairs or multi-star systems. \\\"You get little density spikes within those cocoons, and those are able to collapse and form multiple stars, which we call a fragmentation process,\\\" says Sadavoy. \\\"If they're very far away [from each other], they might never interact. But if they're much closer, gravity has a chance to keep them bound together.\\\" Sadavoy's work showed that it was possible that all stars once started as a binary, and while some remain bound together indefinitely, others would break apart rapidly within a million years. \\\"Stars live for billions of years,\\\" she says. \\\"It is a blip in the grand scheme of things. But so much happens in that blip.\\\" That raises the question of whether the same might have been true of our Sun. There's no reason to think it wasn't, says Sadavoy. But \\\"if we did form with a companion, we lost it\\\", she says. There are some tantalising clues emerging our Sun was once part of a binary system. In 2020, Amir Siraj, an astrophysicist at Harvard University in the US, suggested that a region of icy comets that surrounds our Solar System far beyond Pluto, called the Oort Cloud, might contain an imprint of this companion star. This frigid shell of ice and rock is so far away that the most distant spacecraft ever launched by humankind \\u2013 Voyager 1 \\u2013 will not reach it for at least another 300 years. (Read more about what the Voyager missions are teaching us about the weird space on the outskirts of our Solar System.) If our Sun did have a companion, then it would have resulted in more dwarf planets like Pluto existing in this region, says Siraj. It might also have led to a larger planet ending up here, like the hypothesised Neptune-sized world Planet Nine that some astronomers believe remains undiscovered in our Sun's outer reaches. (Read more about the mystery of Planet Nine in this article by Zaria Gorvett.) \\\"It's hard to produce quite as many objects in the furthest reaches of the Oort Cloud as we see\\\" without a companion star, says Siraj, with billions or even trillions of objects orbiting in the Oort Cloud. If an additional planet like Planet Nine were to be found, explaining how such a planet ended up so far from the Sun is \\\"really hard\\\", says Siraj, unless we invoke the disrupting gravitational hand of a companion star. \\\"It could boost the capture of comets and the chances of the Solar System capturing a planet,\\\" he says. Konstantin Batygin, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology in the US who first proposed the existence of Planet Nine in 2016 based on the clustering of distant objects, isn't so sure about the idea. \\\"A binary companion is by no means required to explain the Oort Cloud,\\\" says Batygin. \\\"You can fully explain the existence of the Oort Cloud just by the fact that the Sun formed in a cluster of stars, and as Jupiter and Saturn grew to their present-day masses, they ejected a bunch of objects.\\\" Even Planet Nine can be explained just by \\\"passing stars in the birth cluster\\\", he says. However, in a recently published research paper, Batygin suggests that the inner edge of the Oort Cloud could be explained by a companion star. \\\"What we found by doing computer simulations is that as objects get scattered out, they start to interact with the binary companion,\\\" says Batygin. \\\"They can detach from the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn and get trapped in the inner Oort Cloud.\\\" It might be possible to confirm if this idea is true with a new telescope in Chile, called the Vera Rubin Observatory, set to switch on next year and perform the most detailed survey ever of the night sky over the following 10 years. \\\"As Vera Rubin comes online and begins to really map out the structure of the Oort Cloud in greater detail, we can see if there's a clear thumbprint of the binary companion,\\\" says Batygin. More like this: Another possible signature of a binary companion's impact is that our Sun is tilted very slightly, by about seven degrees, to the plane of the Solar System. A possible explanation for this is the gravitational pull of another star, which tilted our Sun off balance. \\\"I think the most natural explanation is the presence of a companion star early on,\\\" says Batygin, an effect that we see in other binary stars throughout the galaxy. But even if this early evidence does turn out to be correct, finding our Sun's missing twin may be a far more challenging prospect. It is likely that any companion would now be \\\"lost among the sea of stars that we see in the night sky\\\", says Sadavoy. However, stars born in the same region of space as our Sun might have a similar composition because they will have been forged from the same mix of gases and dust, making them all veritable siblings. In 2018, scientists identified one such \\\"twin\\\" star of our Sun, with a similar size and chemical composition located less than 200 light-years away. Before we get too excited, however, it is worth remembering that the cloud of gas and dust in which our Sun was born also probably formed \\\"hundreds or thousands of stars\\\", says Sadavoy. All of these would have a similar composition, meaning there would be no way to know if any were our Sun's true companion. Even then, any companion of our Sun might not have been a similarly sized star. \\\"It could have been a [smaller] red dwarf star, or a hotter, bluer star,\\\" says Sadavoy. While finding and identifying our Sun's possible companion seems daunting, the prospect that it was once a binary star raises interesting implications for planets around other stars, known as exoplanets. Most notably, it would demonstrate that in our Solar System, the existence of life and the survival of our planets was not diminished by the presence of another star. \\\"There are many discovered exoplanetary systems that actually orbit stellar binaries,\\\" says Li. Some of those orbit one of the two stars, known as circumstellar systems, while others orbit both of the stars and have skies with two suns like the fictional planet Tatooine in Star Wars. These are called circumbinary systems. Sometimes we do see binary companions causing havoc with such systems, though. \\\"It depends on how far away the star is,\\\" says Li. If the star is closer in, it can \\\"kick the planetary orbits\\\" and push them into eccentric, non-circular shapes. \\\"In circumstellar systems, the planets could have a high eccentricity,\\\" says Li. \\\"But this may not necessarily make them unstable.\\\" It can, however, cause the planet to experience large changes in temperature as it swings closer to and further from the star, she says. For our own planet, it seems that the possible existence of a binary companion to our Sun long ago did not hinder our own existence. And as scientists examine the furthest regions of our Solar System in ever more detail, they may well uncover more signs that it once did exist \\u2013 a lasting signature waiting to be found. If it does exist it could be out there, somewhere, with a solar system all of its own. \\\"It might not have trailed too far behind or ahead,\\\" says Sadavoy. \\\"Or it could be on the other side of the galaxy and we would not know. \\\"It could be anywhere.\\\" -- If you liked this story,\\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\\u00a0\\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

            "    One of the main showcases for UK gaming has been cancelled, reflecting the wider struggles of an industry which has seen a series of job cuts and studio closures.The WASD expo which is usually held in London in April is a shop window for British talent, with a particular emphasis on smaller, independent gamemakers.But its organiser has now gone into liquidation.Cofounder David Lilley told the BBC increasing costs and less demand for stand space means running events is just not viable for us anymore.There had been speculation about the events future after the WASD website disappeared from public view months after its 2024 expo took place.But the industry has still reacted with shock and dismay at the confirmation it was no longer going ahead.James Lightfoot, from the UKbased Lightfoot Bros Games, was picked to showcase his game Sleepytime Village at the event this year, and said he was so sad to hear it will be no more.Dave Gilbert, the founder of American independent games developer Wadjet Eye Games, who attended the conference every year, called it an amazing showcase for everything the UK game scene has to offer. WASD first opened its doors in 2022 as an answer to the closure of EGX Rezzed, an offshoot of the London gaming festival EGX, which focused mainly on smaller, alternative video games and their developers.The event typically occurred alongside the London Games Festival in April, which has announced a brand new expo, New Game Plus, which will launch in the same time period next year.As well as talks from industry members, WASD showcased a variety of demos from upcoming smaller games, alongside bigger releases such as Street Fighter 6 and Vampire Survivors. David Lilley told the BBC he recognised the importance of the event for the indie and creator community and wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported us along the way. It comes at a difficult time for inperson gaming events across the UK and the gaming industry as a whole. In September, Insomnia Gaming Festival, the UKs biggest gaming expo, was due to take place in Birmingham, but following a number of layoffs at its organiser, Player1 Events, tickets never went on sale. Whilst Londons other video game showcase EGX did take place this October, it did so in partnership with MCM Comic Con, rather than as a standalone event.The past two years have also seen mass layoffs from some of the industrys biggest companies, such as Xbox makers Microsoft and Sony, which makes PlayStation, following a period of record growth and profits during the Covid19 pandemic.Rachel Watts, games journalist and cohost of the Indieventure Podcast, believes the announcement is a reflection of a wider movement from companies towards announcing their games online. Now that bigger gaming companies are running their own digital events, theres no reason for them to spend time, money, and resources on being present at inperson events.But for indie developers, events like WASD are vital to showcase their games to the public while also building a community within the indie space.\n",
            "Thousands of comic and gaming fans headed to London on Saturday for one of the most colourful days in the UKs convention calendar. Fans flocked to the ExCeL centre for the UKs largest gaming, comic and pop culture convention, many of them dressed in elaborate costumes they had constructed themselves. The event, called MCM X EGX, also brought together hundreds of actors, artists and video game publishers who gave fans a sneak peak at upcoming projects. It was the first time the annual video games show had been combined with MCM which runs Comic Con meaning guests were treated to a wider range of activities, including lightsaber battles, costume contests and card game sessions. Organisers told the BBC more than 100,000 people attended the show, travelling from across the UK and beyond. On the multiple stages dotted around the expo, fans formed long queues to hear from over 700 panellists who were speaking. The venues two halls were filled with displays, stalls and gameplay areas, with more than 450 exhibitors booking places to demonstrate products or sell merchandise. But none of those numbers can capture the energy, passion and excitement of comics and games enthusiasts at the event, on what many told the BBC was the greatest day of the year.My favourite part is meeting other people who are cosplaying, said Catherine Mariah as she travelled to the event on Saturday morning. By the end of the day youll be sad its all over youll have the con blues! Gamers were given handson time with new releases including Call of Duty Black Ops 6 the latest instalment in the hugely popular firstperson shooter series. Fans also got a preview of Avowed an expansive fantasy roleplaying game from US developer Obsidian, which is due for release in February next year. Smaller projects were also on display, like the gesturecontrolled indie game Jazzhands, developed by two University of Nottingham students at a 24hour programming competition.But despite strong fan interest in the video game side of the expo, the gaming industry has been struggling.Several big brands pulled out of this years show after job cuts and an industry strike hit US development schedules.Organisers at MCM X EGX may have hoped that combining EGX with Comic Con would keep the video games expo alive, while getting a bigger audience for the publishers who stuck with them.

            "In 1995, the BBCs Tomorrows World programme decided to predict what the world would look like 30 years later, in 2025.The show, which is no longer broadcast, featured one of the most famous scientists of the age, Prof Stephen Hawking, who predicted By 2025 we can expect big changes.The programme team agreed, suggesting a raft of worldshaking innovations from hologram surgery to space junk gel.So, with the help of some experts and the benefit of three decades of hindsight lets take a look at how much of todays world that Tomorrows World successfully anticipated. In 1995, the world wide web was really taking off a development Tomorrows World thought would bring future trouble.They predicted business barons and banks would take control of the internet by 2000, establishing a supernet which they restricted access to.That, in turn, would prompt hacks, viruses and even riots. Verdict The internet has remained mostly open, and there have been no riots but there is little doubt the actions of hackers have caused misery for many people. One thing the programme didnt predict was the role of the nation state hackers like North Korea, expertly told in the BBCs Lazarus Heist podcast.Cybersecurity is hugely important for governments and companies, and people who are suspicious of banks have championed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The programme speculated space mining would become a lucrative industry, with companies excavating asteroids near Earth for precious metals.The show also suggested space junk would become such a problem it would not be safe for astronauts. The answer a gigantic foam gel to slow down debris. Verdict Well, there is no super foam gel and the problem of space junk is an acute one. There is also no space mining industry but that could change.Futurist Tom Cheesewright is an optimist about mining beyond our planet. The potential riches are unfathomable and the technology is entirely within our grasp, he said. Tomorrows World predicted by 2004, a law would be passed for all UK hospitals to publish a league table of surgeon success rates. The top surgeons would become so popular, and so well paid, it would make no sense for them to travel to patients.Instead, patient holograms would be sent to them and the surgeon would operate using spacial gloves. At the patients end, a robot would perfectly mimic the movements of the surgeon.Verdict They didnt get it exactly right but robots are helping with surgeries. The programme featured a man of the future wearing a fetching VR headset, his wife and a young girl in what appears to be modernday London. In one section, the floating head of a woman comes out of a smart speaker to tell the man it has been a year since his holiday to Indo Disney. She encourages him to take another holiday via a shuttle to Bangalore which would only take 40 minutes.Verdict Ultrafast travel feels as far away as ever, but holograms, smart speakers and VR headsets are becoming ever more prevalent. Elsewhere in the programme, we were given a vision of the future of banking.It featured a woman going to a bank, complaining there were no humans, and then withdrawing 100 Euro marks. The bank gives her the money after scanning a chip in her arm.Verdict Banking has indeed become more and more automated. And though paying via microchips inside the human body is a reality, other technologies mainly fingerprint and face scanning are much more widely used. Gardeners World star Monty Don was one of the presenters on that Tomorrows World programme 30 years ago. His segment predicted a huge restoration of British woodlands thanks to genetic engineering and multistorey agri facilities, leading to the return of animals including the brown bear.Reflecting on it now, he told BBC News that his part of the programme was utopian and naive. Looking towards the next 30 years, he is pleased the current generation of young people are much more sensitive to climate change and thinks people will be growing more of their own food by 2055.Listen on BBC Sounds Tech Life looks forward to 2025He added Tomorrows World was by definition geared towards the way that mankind could change and improve the world, whereas what we have really learnt since then is that mankind has a habit of making things worse, particularly environmentally, and we have to work with nature rather than try modify and control it. Vivienne Parry was another presenter on the prediction show, and fronted a section about medicine.She fondly remembers filming it and the rather limited visual effects of the day. I had to stay absolutely still. I had a set of glasses on with a little camera attached. They were stuck on my face via a big blob of black sticky stuff. It was this fantastically hot day, and this black stuff started to leak down my face and I couldnt move. Someone from makeup came along with a long cane with cotton wool on the end to get it off.Vivienne has been involved with Genomics England since 2013, and highlights that some of the predictions from the 1995 Tomorrows World about genomic sequencing have come true, as she works on a research study to help diagnose and treat genetic conditions. Futurist Tracey Follows thought the 1995 programme got a lot of big ideas right, but missed two of the biggest themes of the last 30 years the spread of big tech and social media.By 2055, she thinks many people will be cognitively connected a hive mind of humans and technology via servers, which will help in the sharing of ideas.Brainstorming will literally be brainstorming, where you can share ideas by thinking them.Tom Cheesewright thinks two of the most exciting prospects for the next 30 years will be materials science and bioengineering. In materials, the creation of devices that are even stronger, lighter and thinner could change the world, while bioengineering married with tight regulation has the power to transform medicine and tackle some of the biggest challenges humanity faces decarbonisation, clean water, food.So what do you think the world will look like in 30 years?Whatever your answers, it would be wise to listen to what Prof Hawking said to Tomorrows World three decades ago. Some of these changes are very exciting, and some are alarming. The one thing that we can be sure of is that it will be very different, and probably not what we expect. With thanks to the BBC Archive team.\n",

            "    One of the main showcases for UK gaming has been cancelled, reflecting the wider struggles of an industry which has seen a series of job cuts and studio closures.The WASD expo which is usually held in London in April is a shop window for British talent, with a particular emphasis on smaller, independent gamemakers.But its organiser has now gone into liquidation.Cofounder David Lilley told the BBC increasing costs and less demand for stand space means running events is just not viable for us anymore.There had been speculation about the events future after the WASD website disappeared from public view months after its 2024 expo took place.But the industry has still reacted with shock and dismay at the confirmation it was no longer going ahead.James Lightfoot, from the UKbased Lightfoot Bros Games, was picked to showcase his game Sleepytime Village at the event this year, and said he was so sad to hear it will be no more.Dave Gilbert, the founder of American independent games developer Wadjet Eye Games, who attended the conference every year, called it an amazing showcase for everything the UK game scene has to offer. WASD first opened its doors in 2022 as an answer to the closure of EGX Rezzed, an offshoot of the London gaming festival EGX, which focused mainly on smaller, alternative video games and their developers.The event typically occurred alongside the London Games Festival in April, which has announced a brand new expo, New Game Plus, which will launch in the same time period next year.As well as talks from industry members, WASD showcased a variety of demos from upcoming smaller games, alongside bigger releases such as Street Fighter 6 and Vampire Survivors. David Lilley told the BBC he recognised the importance of the event for the indie and creator community and wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported us along the way.

            "The boss of US computer chip giant Nvidia has unveiled the firms nextgeneration of gaming chips, known as the RTX 50series.The announcement was part of Jensen Huangs keynote address at CES, an annual technology show in Las Vegas.The new family of chips will use Nvidias Blackwell artificial intelligence AI technology to create moviequality images, he told a packed arena.The chips will range in price from 549 438 to 1,999, and are twice as fast as their predecessors, he added. Mr Huang carried out a realtime demonstration that showed off highly detailed graphics featuring an array of textures and manoeuvres.It was awesome that they can do this in real time, said Gary Yang, a graduate student in robotics at the California Institute of Technology.Previously wed think of these graphics as prerendered.The new chips will start making their way to consumers starting in late January.I thought it was incredible, said Scott Epstein of technology startup Agenovate AI. They are continuing to innovate.Mr Yang and Mr Epstein were among thousands of people who watched the speech both in person and virtually on the eve of the official opening of CES.The convention is expected to draw more than 150,000 attendees and over 4,500 exhibitors over the next week.Nvidias shares touched a new record high on Monday in the runup to Mr Huangs highly anticipated address.He spent the first part of his speech talking about the companys history.Founded in 1993, Nvidia was originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games.Thirtyone years later, Nvidia now stands at the forefront of the development of chips that power AI, with a market value of more than 3tn.However, Nvidia still faces some significant challenges, including from regulators around the world who have raised concerns about its growing dominance of the AI chip market.Last year, the company said it had been contacted by watchdogs in the US, UK, European Union, South Korea, and China.\n",
            "On 29 October 1969, two scientists established a connection between computers some 350 miles away and started typing a message. Halfway through, it crashed. They sat down with the BBC 55 years later. At the height of the Cold War, Charley Kline and Bill Duvall were two brighteyed engineers on the front lines of one of technologys most ambitious experiments. Kline, a 21yearold graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles UCLA, and Duvall, a 29yearold systems programmer at Stanford Research Institute SRI, were working on a system called Arpanet, short for the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Funded by the US Department of Defense, the project aimed to create a network that could directly share data without relying on telephone lines. Instead, this system used a method of data delivery called packet switching that would later form the basis for the modern internet. It was the first test of a technology that would change almost every facet of human life. But before it could work, you had to log in. Kline sat at his keyboard between the limegreen walls of UCLAs Boelter Hall Room 3420, prepared to connect with Duvall, who was working a computer halfway across the state of California. But Kline didnt even make it all the way through the word LOGIN before Duvall told him over the phone that his system crashed. Thanks to that error, the first message that Kline sent Duvall on that autumn day in 1969 was simply the letters LO. They got their connection up and running about an hour later after some tweaks, and that initial crash was just a blip in an otherwise monumental achievement. But neither man realised the significance of the moment. I certainly didnt at that time, Kline says. We were just trying to get it to work. The BBC spoke to Kline and Duvall for the 55th anniversary of the occasion. Half a century later, the internet has shrunk the whole world down to a small black box that fits in your pocket, one that dominates our attention and touches the furthest reaches of lived experience. But it all started with two men, experiencing just how frustrating it is when you cant get online for the very first time. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Can you describe the computers that enabled Arpanet? Were these massive, noisy machines? Kline They were small computers by standards of that time about the size of a refrigerator. They were somewhat noisy from the cooling fans, but quiet compared with the sounds from all the fans in our Sigma 7 computer. There were lights on the front that would blink, switches that could control the IMP Interface Message Processor, and a paper tape reader that could be used to load the software. Duvall They were in a rack big enough to hold a complete set of sound equipment for a large show today. And they were thousands if not millions or billions of times less powerful than the processor in an Apple Watch. These were the old days! Take us inside that moment when you started typing LO. Kline Unlike websites and other systems today, when you connected a terminal to the SRI system nothing happened until you typed something. If you wanted to run a programme, you first needed to login by typing the word login and the system would ask for your user name and password. As I typed a character on my terminal a teletype model 33 it would get sent from my terminal to the programme I wrote for the SDS Sigma 7 computer. That programme would take the character, format it into a message and send it to the Interface Message Processor. When it was received by SRIs system, it would treat the message as if it came from a local terminal and would process it. It would echo the character replicate it on the terminal. In this case, Bills code would take that character and format it into a message and send it to the IMP to go back to UCLA. When I received it, I would print it on my terminal. I was on the phone with Bill when we tried this. I told him I typed the letter L. He told me he had received the letter L and echoed it back. I told him that it printed. Then I typed the letter O. Again, it worked fine. I typed the letter G. Bill told me his system had crashed, and he would call me back. Duvall The UCLA system did not anticipate that it would receive GIN after Charlie had typed LO, so it sent an error message to the SRI computer. I dont recall exactly what the message was, but what happened next was due to the fact that the network connection was much faster than anything seen before. The normal connection speed was 10 characters per second whereas the Arpanet could transmit characters at up to 5,000 characters per second. The result of this message being sent from UCLA to the SRI computer flooded the input buffer which only expected 10 characters per second. It was like filling a glass with a fire hose. I quickly discovered what had happened, changed the buffer size and rebuilt the system, which took about an hour. Did you realise this could be a historic moment? Kline No, I certainly didnt at that time. Duvall Not really. It was another step forward in the larger context of the work we were doing at SRI which we did believe would have a large impact. When Samuel Morse sent the first telegraph message in 1844, he had an eye for drama, tapping out What hath God wrought on a line from Washington, DC to Baltimore, Maryland, US. If you could go back, would you have typed something more memorable? Kline Of course, if I had realised its importance. But we were just trying to get it to work. Duvall No. This was the first test of a very complicated system with a lot of moving parts. To have something this complex work in the very first test was dramatic in and of itself. What was the atmosphere like when the message was sent? Duvall We were each alone in our respective computer laboratories at night. We were both happy to have had such a successful first test as the culmination of a lot of work. I went to a local watering hole and had a burger and a beer. Kline I was happy that it worked and went home to get some sleep. What did you expect Arpanet to become? Duvall I saw the work we were doing at SRI as a critical part of a larger vision, that of information workers connected to each other and sharing problems, observations, documents and solutions. What we did not see was the commercial adoption nor did we anticipate the phenomenon of social media and the associated disinformation plague. Although, it should be noted, that in SRI computer scientist Douglas Engelbarts 1962 treatise describing the overall vision, he notes that the capabilities we were creating would trigger profound change in our society, and it would be necessary to simultaneously use and adapt the tools we were creating to address the problems which would arise from their use in society. What aspects of the internet today remind you of Arpanet? Duvall Referring to the larger vision which was being created in Engelbarts group the mouse, full screen editing, links, etc., the internet today is a logical evolution of those ideas enhanced, of course, by the contributions of many bright and innovative people and organisations. Kline The ability to use resources from others. Thats what we do when we use a website. We are using the facilities of the website and its programmes, features, etc. And, of course, email. The Arpanet pretty much created the concept of routing and multiple paths from one site to another. That got reliability in case a communication line failed. It also allowed increases in communication speeds by using multiple paths simultaneously. Those concepts have carried over to the internet. As we developed the communications protocols for the Arpanet, we discovered problems, redesigned and improved the protocols and learned many lessons that carried over to the Internet. TCPIP the basic standard for internet connection was developed both to interconnect networks, in particular the Arpanet with other networks, and also to improve performance, reliability and more. How do you feel about this anniversary? Kline Thats a mix. Personally, I feel it is important, but a little overblown. The Arpanet and what sprang from it are very important. This particular anniversary to me is just one of many events. I find somewhat more important than this particular anniversary were the decisions by Arpa to build the Network and continue to support its development. Duvall Its nice to remember the origin of something like the internet, but the most important thing is the enormous amount of work that has been done since that time to turn it into what is a major part of societies worldwide. The modern web is dominated not by government or academic researchers, but by some of the largest companies in the world. How do you feel about what the internet has become? What are you most concerned about? Kline We use it in our daily lives, and it is very important. Its hard to imagine ever not having it again. One of the benefits of it being so open and not controlled by a government is that new ideas can get developed, such as online shopping, banking, video streaming, news sites, social media, and more. But because it has become so important to our lives it is a target for malicious activity. We hear constantly about how things have been compromised. There is a tremendous loss of privacy. And the big companies Google, Meta, Amazon and internet service providers such as Comcast and ATT have too much power in my opinion. But I am not sure of the right remedy. Duvall I think that there is great danger in the domination by any single entity. We have seen the power of disinformation in directing policy and elections. We have also seen the power of companies in influencing the direction of social norms and the formation of adults and young adults. Kline One of my biggest fears has been about the spread of false information. How many times have you heard someone say, I saw it on the internet. It was always possible to spread false information, but it would cost money to send out mailers, put up a billboard or take out a TV ad. Now it is cheap and easy. And as it reaches millions of people, it gets repeated and treated as fact. Another fear is that as more and more critical systems have moved onto the internet it becomes easier to cause a serious disruption if those systems are taken down or compromised. For example, not only communications systems but banking, utilities, transportation, etc. Duvall It has great power but, not heeding Engelbarts warning in 1962, we have not effectively used the power of the internet to manage the social impact. Are there any lessons from your time at Arpanet that could make it a better place for everyone? Kline While the openness of the internet allows experimentation and new uses, the lack of control can lead to compromises. Arpa kept some control of the Arpanet. That way they could make sure that everything worked, make decisions about which protocols were required, deal with issues such as site names and other issues. More Like This Google just updated its algorithm. The Internet will never be the same Postcards are the email of their day How cat memes went viral 100 years ago Were losing our digital history. Can the Internet Archive save it? While Icann the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers still manages some of that, there have been international disagreements about how to move forward and whether the US has too much control, etc. But we still need some controls to keep the network functional. Also, since the Arpanet was relatively small, we could experiment with major changes in design, protocols, and more. That would be extremely hard now. Duvall We are standing on the edge of a precipice with AI and the reflexive access it has to everyone who graces the internet. The internet had explosive growth and development some of it socially damaging in the early days. AI now stands at that threshold, and is inseparable from the internet. And it is not unreasonable to call AI an existential threat. The time to recognise the dangers as well as the promise is now.

            "    Today in the Executive Lounge, one global firms innovative solutions to the universal problem of small businesses struggling to survive. The small business sector has a big problem. Its called the missing middle, which refers to the gap in provision of financial services and support for small and mediumsized enterprises SMEs. These businesses are seemingly caught between a rock and a hard place theyre too big to qualify for microfinance and too small to be eligible for regular bank loans. Consequently, 67 of SMEs worldwide are fighting for survival, according to the World Economic Forum. A number of international finance institutions, most notably the World Bank, have attempted to close the funding gap, so far with mixed results. This is despite adopting a dualpronged approach, which includes helping to make SMEs more attractive for investment and liaising with financial institutions in an effort to boost lending. But the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development says the success of any international organisation aiming to bridge the financial services gap in a particular region hinges on having a strong local presence there, which can understand and meet the needs of SMEs effectively. Perhaps surprisingly, Mastercard has stepped up to meet this hyperlocal need. Contrary to popular opinion, Mastercard isnt a credit card company. It doesnt extend credit to consumers or issue them with credit cards. In fact, the companys main function is to process payments. Mastercard has always put financial inclusion at the top of its agenda, Shamina Singh, the companys executive vice president of sustainability says. Singh is responsible for, among other things, developing and implementing environmental, social and governance ESG strategy across the company. As the global economy becomes increasingly digitised, one challenge we face is to ensure that new, technologydriven ways of storing, lending, saving, sending and investing money are designed for inclusion, especially for small businesses, says Singh. Singh highlights Mastercards Inclusive Growth Score, a tool that provides local financial institutions with a clear view of a particular communitys social and economic indicators so they can reliably predict if a small business will thrive there. We work closely with our colleagues on the ground in a particular region, so we can better understand if there are viable market opportunities there, and the regulatory environment is supportive of building up small businesses. Mastercards Strive small business programme is one solution thats emerged from this research. Designed to address the transition to the digital economy necessitated by Covid19, which disproportionately affected businesses led by women and ethnic minorities, Strive helps small businesses access the tools and resources they need to digitise. Strive is intended to be a handinglove fit for businesses of all kinds and all around the world some graduates include Sparkle Lighting, a lighting design company in the heart of the UK, and Kelsie Kays Coffee Depot situated on a Native American reservation in South Dakota. When we launched our first Strive programme, the financing gap for small businesses was 930bn 743bn in low and lowermiddleincome countries, Singh explains.Globally, this figure was 5.2tn 4.15tn annually. Singh talks to the BBC about the progress made to shrink that disparity and the work still to be done to ensure small businesses worldwide have what they need, and a vibrant middle can once again be found. What inspired the launch of this small business initiative in 2021? When seeking credit, some of the small business community falls between the cracks. We call them the missing middle and they often lack funds to grow. In addition, digitalisation emerged as a survival tool during the pandemic, enabling small businesses to remain in operation during lockdowns. But not all businesses benefitted equally from the shift to digital. Covid19 quickly exposed deep inequalities and tested the resilience of small businesses especially those operating in the cash economy. The shift to digital has been uneven, and too many small businesses are still unable to benefit from, or fully participate in, the growing digital economy. Even before the pandemic, small businesses were falling behind their larger competitors in terms of integrating digital technologies into their operations. We developed Strive to help build the resilience of small businesses by helping them go digital, get capital and access networks and knowhow. What role does data play in steering the programme? Before launching each Strive programme, we conduct thorough market analysis to understand the unique issues and the needs micro and small businesses face in that particular market. For example, before launching Strive UK, we conducted quantitative research with over 1,000 small businesses in the UK in addition to a listening tour across the UK with indepth qualitative interviews with expert organisations supporting SMEs across the public and private sectors. Our datadriven approach enables us to monitor our programmes efficiency and iterate as needed. What criteria does the programme use to determine which countries, territories and regions to prioritise? We have Strive programmes in multiple markets, from Czechia to the UK. Before we launch a programme in a particular region, we assess what that market and its small business owners need, which may be unique to that area. After all, different markets have different needs. One example is Strive Women, which covers countries such as Pakistan, Vietnam and Peru. Our research shows that, in these regions, men have greater access to productive assets and influence over familial decisionmaking. For instance, in Pakistan, only 33 of male entrepreneurs have had to seek their familys permission before starting their business while nearly 60 of female entrepreneurs felt the need to obtain their familys approval, mainly from their father or husband. Contrast this with Strive USA. Small businesses which are defined as those with 500 employees or fewer comprise 99 of all businesses in the US and employ more than 60 million people. Yet, despite their importance, half of these new businesses will fail within five years often because they cant access the capital, tools and networks they need to stay afloat. These challenges disproportionally affect underserved businesses and help explain the huge racial wealth gap that exists between white and minorityowned small business owners. Is there one small business success story that stands out? In Vietnam, we worked with Luu Thi Hoa, the founder of an agricultural cooperative in the city of Ha Giang. Hoa started her business in 2017, mainly offline, selling Ha Giang specialties such as honey, herbs and vegetables to tourists. She joined our Ignite program in 2021 with training in financial management, digital marketing, art therapy to manage stress and business planning. Hoa was selected to receive seed funding which she used to finetune her packaging and join another online marketing course with a focus on ecommerce platforms sales techniques. During our latest conversation with Hoa, she shared that her business grew by 10 to 15 over the last two years.

Digital is a big opportunity. We created a social enterprise called Farm Pass, which provides a digital marketplace for farmers to access larger markets and negotiate a fair price for their produce. We worked with farmers for example tomato farmers in India to create a new type of network that allows them to engage with each other, and the benefits to farmers are clear.

            "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.I went with a backpack, and set up a business, says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing the cliché that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time. Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner youd get attention, he says.Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.The countrys standard corporation tax rate the amount that firms have to pay on their profits is just 12. This compares with 25 in the UK, and 25.8 in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.Theres an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the countrys IT sector the Moldova IT Park MITP.This isnt a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7.The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.This drive is being led by Moldovas proEU President Maia Sandu, who this week was reelected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted yes on proEU constitutional changes.However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46 and No receiving 49.54. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldovas authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy.Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldovas breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily. Dumitru Alaiba, Moldovas deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that its a country that can change very fast, he tells the BBC. This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.He pointed to Moldovas rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anticorruption watchdog Transparency International. Out of 180 countries with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with. Member companies of the MITP dont just benefit from the 7 corporation tax rate. They also dont need to make employer social security contributions, and staff dont have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined 365m 397m 308m in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6 of the countrys GDP.While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldovas IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than 100,000 a year, because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany. At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine.Marina Bzovii, MITPs administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.However, Moldova understands both of the cultures. So its the kind of business hub that Europe needs... and Chisinau is now really vibrant.\n",
            "An entrepreneur who quit his highpaying job with Google to build up his own food business said he only had 10 worth of ingredients when he started out.Simmy Dhillon, 27, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, said money was tight while growing up, with his father working in a factory and his mother doing shifts at a supermarket.He said his childhood dream had been to make enough money to allow his parents to retire.The main motivator was seeing my parents struggle and not being in the same position as them as an adult, he said. Mr Dhillon, cofounder of Hitchinbased Simmer Eats, was 19 and studying Economics at the University of Bristol when he started cooking and selling meals to his peers as a side hustle.Now that has evolved into a multimillionpound business, delivering thousands of meals across the country daily.Initially Mr Dhillon planned to become an investment banker.I thought it the business would help me get the best internships and graduate jobs, because they are going to see proactivity and initiative, he said. After becoming the first person in his family to graduate, he landed a marketing job at Google that he quit to follow his passion.Seven years after launching his business, he said his healthy ready meals had caught the attention of rapper Central Cee and Premier League footballer Alex Iwobi.In 2024, he managed to complete his dream of funding his parents retirement. He said the achievement has a very unique feeling, full of emotion and pride youve spent your whole life trying to achieve something and then it finally happens. Although he remained tightlipped on how much money he had made through the business, he said it had made more than 10m in revenue.Simmer Eats was ranked at 11 in the Sunday Times Hundred 2024, a list of Britains fastestgrowing companies, with annual sales growth of 184 over three years.Mr Dhillon said it now had 15 fulltime employees, including chefs who cooked the meals before they were delivered all over the UK.Where we are today is exceptional, but it has happened very slowly over seven years time and weve been working on it every single day, he said.If I stayed at Google and did the best work possible, I still wouldnt be anywhere near where I am now. Weve sold over a million meals in the last 12 months.Mr Dhillon cofounded the business with his older brother Jhai, 29, a former professional footballer who quit his job as an accountant with Ernst and Young to work for it. Mr Dhillon said the pair grew up learning to be frugal. Dad said, You have to work hard so you dont end up with a bad job like me. Thats what he would say to us from a very young age.I didnt want to let my parents down by having all of the opportunities they didnt have, but ending up in the same situation.They said Were doing blue collar jobs so you can have stability and have the opportunities that we didnt have.During a university summer holiday, he had an internship at an investment bank and said the people round him were earning silly money.The lowestpaid people were on 50,000 a year which was more than both of my parents salaries combined, he said.He said his own earnings of 5,000 a month then felt like a huge amount of money to me but he wanted to put it all into his business.I was always really frugal. I asked a friend in London if I could crash on his couch but the couch was too small, so I slept on the kitchen floor on a little blowup mattress, he said.Living like that wasnt fun but it just made me appreciate a comfortable bed more and it made me realise that you dont have to have a lot you can survive, and people live in much worse conditions.Now Mr Dhillon wants his firm to become a household name in the UK.I want to build a legacy, he said.
